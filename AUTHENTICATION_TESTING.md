### 4. Session Management ✅

#### Session Persistence

- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Refresh page - session should persist
- [ ] Close and reopen browser - session should persist
- [ ] Check localStorage/sessionStorage for session data

#### Session Expiry

- [ ] Wait for session to expire (or manually expire)
- [ ] Try to access protected route
- [ ] Verify redirect to login page
- [ ] Login again - should work normally

#### Logout Flow

- [ ] Login successfully
- [ ] Click logout in user dropdown menu
- [ ] Verify redirect to login page
- [ ] Verify session cleared
- [ ] Try to access protected route - should redirect to login

### 5. Route Protection ✅

#### Protected Routes

- [ ] Access `/` without authentication → redirect to `/auth/login`
- [ ] Access `/dashboard` without authentication → redirect to `/auth/login`
- [ ] Access `/template-builder` without authentication → redirect to login
- [ ] Access `/quote-management` without authentication → redirect to login
- [ ] Access `/settings` without authentication → redirect to login

#### Public Routes

- [ ] Access `/auth/login` → should render login page
- [ ] Access `/auth/signup` → should render signup page
- [ ] Access `/auth/forgot-password` → should render forgot password page
- [ ] Access `/unauthorized` → should render unauthorized page

### 6. Role-Based Access Control ✅

#### User Role (Default)

- [ ] Login as regular user
- [ ] Verify role shows as "user" in UI
- [ ] Verify no admin badge visible
- [ ] Try to access admin-only features (should fail)

#### Admin Role

- [ ] Set user role to "admin" in Supabase Dashboard:
  ```json
  { "role": "admin" }
  ```
- [ ] Login as admin user
- [ ] Verify "Admin" badge shows in user dropdown
- [ ] Verify role shows as "admin" in UI
- [ ] Access admin-only features (should work)

#### Role Assignment (Backend Only)

- [ ] Verify signup form does NOT have role selection
- [ ] Verify new users default to "user" role
- [ ] Verify roles can only be changed via Supabase Dashboard

### 7. Error Handling & Edge Cases ✅

#### Network Issues

- [ ] Disconnect internet during login
- [ ] Verify proper error message displays
- [ ] Reconnect and retry - should work

#### Invalid Tokens

- [ ] Manually corrupt auth token in localStorage
- [ ] Try to access protected route
- [ ] Verify graceful handling and redirect to login

#### Callback Errors

- [ ] Test invalid auth callback URL
- [ ] Test expired callback tokens
- [ ] Verify error handling in `/auth/callback`

#### Component Error Boundaries

- [ ] Trigger authentication error
- [ ] Verify AuthErrorBoundary catches and displays error
- [ ] Test recovery options (reload, try again)

### 8. UI/UX Consistency ✅

#### Design System Compliance

- [ ] Verify all auth pages use existing design system
- [ ] Check color scheme matches app theme
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Test loading states and animations
- [ ] Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

#### Navigation & Flow

- [ ] Test all links between auth pages work correctly
- [ ] Verify proper back navigation
- [ ] Check redirect flows after authentication
- [ ] Test "remember me" functionality (session persistence)

## Test Data Setup

### Test Users

1. **Regular User**: `user@lushquote.test`
2. **Admin User**: `admin@lushquote.test` (set role in Supabase)
3. **Unverified User**: `unverified@lushquote.test`

### Test Passwords

- Valid: `password123`
- Too Short: `pass`
- Strong: `StrongPassword123!`

## Manual Testing Commands

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Check Supabase Connection

```bash
# In browser console on any auth page:
console.log(supabase.auth.getSession())
```

### Database Role Functions Test

```sql
-- Check if functions work
SELECT public.get_user_role();
SELECT public.is_admin();
```

## Automated Testing (Future Enhancement)

### Test Framework Setup

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom vitest
```

### Example Test Structure

```javascript
// src/tests/auth/Login.test.jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import Login from "@/pages/auth/Login";

test("renders login form", () => {
  render(<Login />);
  expect(screen.getByPlaceholderText("Enter your email")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Performance Testing

### Metrics to Monitor

- [ ] Auth provider initialization time < 100ms
- [ ] Login/logout response time < 2s
- [ ] Session validation time < 50ms
- [ ] Page load time for protected routes < 1s

### Memory Leaks

- [ ] Check for subscription cleanup in useEffect
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks in auth context
- [ ] Monitor browser memory usage during auth flows

## Security Testing

### OWASP Guidelines

- [ ] Verify HTTPS in production
- [ ] Check for XSS vulnerabilities in auth forms
- [ ] Test SQL injection on auth endpoints
- [ ] Verify proper session timeout
- [ ] Check for CSRF protection

### Supabase Security

- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- [ ] Proper JWT validation
- [ ] Secure token storage
- [ ] API key security (anon key only)

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Google OAuth credentials set up
- [ ] Site URL configured correctly
- [ ] Email templates customized
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Monitoring and logging set up
- [ ] SSL certificates valid
- [ ] Error tracking enabled (Sentry, etc.)

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: Google OAuth redirect mismatch

**Workaround**: Ensure all redirect URIs match exactly in Google Cloud Console

### Issue: Session not persisting

**Workaround**: Check localStorage/sessionStorage settings and domain configuration

### Issue: Email confirmation not received

**Workaround**: Check spam folder, verify SMTP configuration in Supabase
