# Navbar Plan Display Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

**Symptoms:**

1. ‚úÖ Settings page shows "Premium" correctly
2. ‚úÖ Database shows subscription_tier = "premium"
3. ‚ùå Navbar (sidebar) shows "Free Plan"
4. ‚ùå Can't create more than 1 template (free plan limit enforced)

**Root Cause:**
The Layout component (which renders the navbar) was reading from `user?.user_metadata?.subscription_tier`, which comes from Supabase Auth user object. However, the subscription tier is stored in the `user_profiles` table in the database, not in the auth user metadata.

The `useAuth` hook was only returning the auth user object without fetching and merging the user profile data.

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Enhanced `useAuth` Hook

**Added `fetchUserProfile()` function:**

- Fetches user data from `user_profiles` table
- Merges profile data with auth user object
- Updates both user object and user_metadata for backward compatibility
- Includes comprehensive logging

**Key Changes:**

```javascript
// Now fetches profile data with subscription tier
const userWithProfile = await fetchUserProfile(session.user);
setUser(userWithProfile); // This includes subscription_tier!
```

**Added Event Listener:**

- Listens for `userUpdated` custom event
- Automatically refreshes user data when event is triggered
- Fired after payment success or settings update

### 2. Updated Dashboard Component

**Added Event Dispatch:**

- Dispatches `userUpdated` event after detecting premium upgrade
- Also dispatches after retry attempts (in case of timing issues)
- Triggers Layout/navbar to refresh immediately

**Enhanced Logging:**

- Shows when user state is updated
- Logs subscription tier at each step
- Clear emoji indicators for easy debugging

### 3. How It Works Now

**Flow:**

1. **Initial Load:**

   ```
   [useAuth] Getting initial session...
   [useAuth] Session found, fetching user profile...
   [useAuth] Profile fetched successfully: {
     subscription_tier: "premium",
     subscription_status: "active"
   }
   ```

2. **Layout Renders:**

   - Reads from `user?.user_metadata?.subscription_tier`
   - Now has "premium" value (merged from profile)
   - Displays "Premium Plan" in navbar ‚úÖ

3. **After Payment Success:**

   ```
   üéâ User successfully upgraded to premium!
   üì° Dispatching userUpdated event to refresh navbar...
   [useAuth] userUpdated event received, refreshing user data...
   [useAuth] Profile fetched successfully: { subscription_tier: "premium" }
   ```

4. **Navbar Updates:**
   - Automatically refreshes with new data
   - Shows "Premium Plan" immediately ‚úÖ
   - Template creation limit removed ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

### ‚úÖ File: `src/hooks/useAuth.jsx`

**Changes:**

1. Added `fetchUserProfile()` function
2. Calls `fetchUserProfile()` on initial load
3. Calls `fetchUserProfile()` on auth state changes
4. Added event listener for `userUpdated` event
5. Merges profile data with auth user
6. Comprehensive logging throughout

**Impact:**

- User object now includes subscription_tier from database
- Layout/navbar shows correct plan
- Template creation limit respects actual plan

### ‚úÖ File: `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

**Changes:**

1. Dispatches `userUpdated` event after payment success
2. Dispatches event after retry attempts (fallback)
3. Added logging for user state updates

**Impact:**

- Navbar refreshes immediately after upgrade
- No page refresh needed

### ‚úÖ File: `src/pages/Layout.jsx` (No changes needed!)

**Why?**

- Already reading from `user?.user_metadata?.subscription_tier`
- Now gets correct data from enhanced useAuth hook
- Template creation logic automatically fixed

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Current Plan Display

**Open browser console and look for:**

```
[useAuth] Profile fetched successfully: {
  email: "user@example.com",
  subscription_tier: "premium",  ‚Üê Should show "premium"
  subscription_status: "active"
}
```

**Check navbar (bottom left):**

- Should display: "Premium Plan" (green text)
- NOT "Free Plan"

### 2. Test Template Creation

1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template" button
3. Should navigate to template builder (not show upgrade dialog)
4. Create a second template
5. Should work without restrictions

### 3. Test After Payment

1. Complete a payment (if starting from free)
2. Watch console logs:
   ```
   üéâ User successfully upgraded to premium!
   üì° Dispatching userUpdated event to refresh navbar...
   [useAuth] userUpdated event received, refreshing user data...
   ```
3. Navbar should update to "Premium Plan" within 2-6 seconds
4. No page refresh needed

## Console Logs to Verify

### On Page Load:

```
[useAuth] Getting initial session...
[useAuth] Session found, fetching user profile...
[useAuth] Fetching user profile for: user@example.com
[useAuth] Profile fetched successfully: {
  email: "user@example.com",
  subscription_tier: "premium",
  subscription_status: "active"
}
```

### After Payment Success:

```
Fresh user data after reload: {
  email: "user@example.com",
  tier: "premium",
  status: "active"
}
üéâ User successfully upgraded to premium!
üì° Dispatching userUpdated event to refresh navbar...
[useAuth] userUpdated event received, refreshing user data...
[useAuth] Fetching user profile for: user@example.com
[useAuth] Profile fetched successfully: { subscription_tier: "premium" }
```

## Verify Database

```sql
-- Check your user profile in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT
  email,
  subscription_tier,
  subscription_status,
  stripe_customer_id,
  stripe_subscription_id
FROM user_profiles
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

**Should show:**

- subscription_tier: "premium"
- subscription_status: "active"
- stripe_customer_id: "cus_xxxxx"
- stripe_subscription_id: "sub_xxxxx"

## What Should Work Now

### ‚úÖ Navbar Display

- Shows correct plan ("Premium Plan" or "Free Plan")
- Updates automatically after payment
- Synced with database

### ‚úÖ Template Creation

- Premium users: Unlimited templates
- Free users: Max 1 template (enforced correctly)
- No false limits

### ‚úÖ Settings Page

- Already worked (uses User.me() directly)
- Now consistent with navbar

### ‚úÖ Dashboard Stats

- Shows correct plan badge
- Upgrade prompts only for actual free users

## Troubleshooting

### If navbar still shows "Free Plan":

1. **Clear browser cache and reload**
2. **Check console logs:**
   ```javascript
   // Should see:
   [useAuth] Profile fetched successfully: { subscription_tier: "premium" }
   ```
3. **If logs show "free":**
   - Check database (see SQL query above)
   - Verify webhook processed correctly
4. **If database shows "premium" but logs show "free":**
   - Check RLS policies on user_profiles table
   - Ensure authenticated users can read their own profile

### If can't create multiple templates:

1. **Check console when clicking "Create Template":**
   ```javascript
   // Should see in Layout.jsx handleNavClick:
   evaluatedTier = "premium"; // Not 'free'
   ```
2. **If still shows 'free':**
   - Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
   - Check browser console for useAuth logs

### Force Refresh:

```javascript
// In browser console, run:
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("userUpdated"));
```

This will force useAuth to refetch user profile data.

## Files Modified
