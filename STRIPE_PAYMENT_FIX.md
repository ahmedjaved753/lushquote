# Stripe Payment & Webhook Fix

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Webhook Error** (CRITICAL - Now Fixed)

**Problem:** Webhook was failing with error:

```
SubtleCryptoProvider cannot be used in a synchronous context.
Use `await constructEventAsync(...)` instead of `constructEvent(...)`
```

**Solution:** Updated both webhook files to use async method:

- ‚úÖ `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`
- ‚úÖ `edge-functions/stripe-webhook.ts`

**Changes:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken):
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, signature, webhookSecret);

// AFTER (Fixed):
const event = await stripe.webhooks.constructEventAsync(
  body,
  signature,
  webhookSecret
);
```

### 2. **Success Page Quick Redirect** (Now Fixed)

**Problem:** After successful payment, the success page would flash and redirect too quickly without showing the upgraded status.

**Solution:** Enhanced Dashboard.jsx to:

1. Show initial success toast: "Payment successful! Loading your upgraded account..."
2. Wait 2 seconds for webhook to process
3. Reload user data to fetch updated subscription tier
4. Show celebratory toast: "Welcome to LushQuote Premium! üéâ"

### 3. **User Plan Not Upgrading** (Now Fixed)

**Problem:** User subscription tier wasn't being updated in the database.

**Root Cause:** The webhook was failing (Issue #1), so the database update never happened.

**Solution:**

- Fixed webhook to properly process events
- Added comprehensive logging to track upgrade process
- Added error handling to catch and log any database update issues

## What Happens Now (Expected Flow)

### Step-by-Step Payment Flow:

1. **User clicks "Upgrade to Premium"**

   - Creates Stripe checkout session
   - Redirects to Stripe payment page

2. **User completes payment on Stripe**

   - Stripe processes payment
   - Redirects user to: `https://your-app.com/dashboard?stripe_success=true`

3. **Stripe sends webhook to your backend**

   - Webhook receives `checkout.session.completed` event
   - Updates user profile in database:
     - `subscription_tier` ‚Üí `"premium"`
     - `subscription_status` ‚Üí `"active"`
     - `stripe_customer_id` ‚Üí customer ID
     - `stripe_subscription_id` ‚Üí subscription ID
     - `monthly_submission_count` ‚Üí reset to 0

4. **Dashboard loads and detects success**
   - Shows toast: "Payment successful! Loading your upgraded account..."
   - Waits 2 seconds for webhook processing
   - Reloads user data
   - Shows success message: "Welcome to LushQuote Premium! üéâ"
   - User sees Premium badge and features unlocked

## Enhanced Logging

The webhook now includes detailed console logs to help debug any issues:

```typescript
console.log("Updating user profile with data:", updateData);
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("user_profiles")
  .update(updateData)
  .eq("id", session.metadata.supabase_user_id)
  .select();

if (error) {
  console.error("Error updating user profile:", error);
} else {
  console.log("User profile updated successfully:", data);
  console.log(
    `‚úÖ User ${session.metadata.supabase_user_id} upgraded to premium`
  );
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test a New Payment:

1. **Login to your app** as a free user
2. **Go to Dashboard** or Settings
3. **Click "Upgrade to Premium"**
4. **Use Stripe test card:**

   - Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)

5. **Complete the payment**
6. **Watch for success messages:**

   - "Payment successful! Loading your upgraded account..."
   - "Welcome to LushQuote Premium! üéâ"

7. **Verify upgrade worked:**
   - Check Dashboard - should show "Premium" badge
   - Check Settings - should show "Current Plan: Premium"
   - Try creating multiple templates (should work now)
   - Check CSV export is available

### Monitor Webhook Logs:

```bash
# View webhook logs in real-time
supabase functions logs stripe-webhook --follow

# Or check in Supabase Dashboard:
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/functions
```

### Expected Webhook Logs:

```
Received webhook event: checkout.session.completed
Checkout session completed: cs_test_xxxxx
Updating user profile with data: {
  subscription_tier: "premium",
  subscription_status: "active",
  stripe_customer_id: "cus_xxxxx",
  stripe_subscription_id: "sub_xxxxx",
  subscription_current_period_end: "2025-11-02T...",
  monthly_submission_count: 0
}
User profile updated successfully: [...]
‚úÖ User abcd-1234-efgh-5678 upgraded to premium
```

## Troubleshooting

### If webhook still fails:

1. **Check webhook secret is set:**

   ```bash
   supabase secrets list
   ```

   Should show: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

2. **Verify webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard:**

   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - URL should be: `https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
   - Events to send: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_failed`

3. **Check webhook signature:**
   - Each webhook endpoint has a unique signing secret
   - Make sure the secret in your Supabase project matches the webhook endpoint

### If user plan doesn't upgrade:

1. **Check webhook processed successfully** (see logs above)
2. **Check user_profiles table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, subscription_tier, subscription_status
   FROM user_profiles
   WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
   ```
3. **Verify RLS policies allow service role to update:**
   - Webhook uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` which bypasses RLS

### If success page redirects too fast:

- The 2-second delay should be enough for most cases
- If webhook is slow, you can increase the delay in Dashboard.jsx (line 62):
  ```javascript
  setTimeout(() => {
    loadData();
  }, 2000); // Increase to 3000 or 4000 if needed
  ```

## Files Modified

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Test the payment flow** with Stripe test card
2. ‚úÖ **Monitor webhook logs** to confirm events are processing
3. ‚úÖ **Verify user upgrades** are working correctly
4. üìù **Document** any additional issues found during testing

## Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Switch from test mode to live mode in Stripe
- [ ] Update webhook endpoint with live webhook secret
- [ ] Test with real card (small amount)
- [ ] Set up webhook failure alerts in Stripe
- [ ] Monitor Supabase function logs regularly
- [ ] Test subscription cancellation flow
- [ ] Test subscription renewal flow
